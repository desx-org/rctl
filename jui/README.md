jui is a data interchage format and programming language that allowes for the storage and transfer of data wich includes a mechanism for descibing the data programatically. In effect, JUI is a single compact and portable executable that includes:

 - Language interepter
 - Package manager
 - Version Control
 - Command Line IDE/Edor 
 - Documentation Generator 
 - Unit Test framework

JUI Does not:
 - Include any IO functionality. a JUI object defines data and data transforms. 
 - Prioritize Perfomance. 
 - 

 KEY Targets:
 - The operations a JUI object perfoms are deterministic and absolutley repeatable.
 - JUI package resolution is always deterministic and repeatable. objects import other JUI objects based on Hash functions. 
 - All the information about a jui file is in a single file.
